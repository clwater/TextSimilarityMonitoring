However, if U.S. allies lose faith on the dollar, the U.S. economy will need to play under the same rules than everybody else. Regarding this, the paradox is that now the trade deficit doesn’t matter at all regarding U.S. macroeconomics, because the U.S. can buy with printed-at-home paper any foreign good that it desires or needs, without having to sell something produced in the U.S. in the international market first. But the current U.S. administration policies can make the trade deficit a very real problem for the U.S. If the dollar loses its role due to a liquidity crisis (a possibility still remote but real in different scenarios of the trade war, and by different paths), that role will be sorely missed by a country that so far has not been playing with the same monetary rules that apply to most of the world. In this sense, it is worth remembering that the U.S. economy has been playing under those special rules for over seventy years, so it is far from being ready to compete for resources and markets without the huge advantage provided by the special role of its currency, or to assume its own huge national debt by itself without being helped by foreign investors buying U.S. “securities”.

Indeed, there’s a lot from the book that people tend not to remember. Atticus’ portrayal in the sequel, Go Set a Watchman upset many people because of his racism in that book, which they felt didn’t follow from To Kill a Mockingbird. Thing is, it does follow: either Atticus has a gigantic blind spot where his sister is concerned — unlikely — or he decides the best thing he can do in raising his children is to bring a more racist (and classist) presence into their lives. It’s not a good look for the guy.

One difference between those who moved up and those who moved down in economic terms, seems to be the capacity to identify and set reasonable goals and to accomplish them quickly and efficiently. I have spent time in the homes of families who have both lower-middle-class and upper-middle class people among the extended clan. For example, for a 6 AM flight, where it’s necessary to leave the house at 4:30 AM, the upper-middle class family members are up, [shaved], hair done, dressed, [make-up on], packed, and children dressed and packed, and all on their way out the door . . . and the rooms in which they stayed have been left immaculate, with the beds stripped and the linens ready to go into the laundry . . . while at least one of the lower-middle-class relatives are still struggling to find their phone and another to unjam the stuck zippers on their carry-ons. And the rooms in which the lower-middle-class relatives had stayed look a complete mess - like the proverbial war zone. . . and the children are still looking for toys they’ve left behind.

Where England and France set out to fulfill the terrible scientific racism and the supposed "white man's burden" where they set out to give culture to the acculturated.The plain truth was that Africa is very rich in raw materials, it is a large consumer market and still provides cheap labor. At that time, they attested that the African was inferior in intelligence and culture.Common biopiracy and still exploitation of all kinds as well. They entered the continent.The Treaty of Berlin of 1885 ratified that. The Europeans imposed to the continent a sharing of borders and the Africans accepted, although they were exploited and at that moment, dominated by the Europeans.Another evidence of this is the fact that the great majority of African capitals are located on the coast. They were the best cities, largest populations and best infrastructure because the Europeans arrived in the port, extracted the raw materials arriving in the zones of train production, returned to port and went away.
